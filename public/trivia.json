There were about twenty-five present.  Letters were read from many prominent gentlemen who could not come to the meeting, but who wished to express their approval of the project.”\nThe Van Ness House opened in 1897 and was named for Vermont Governor Cornelius P. Van Ness.   It burned in 1951.  Today, a historic marker commemorating the founding of the GMC marks the spot where the hotel once stood.",

After growing frustrated with the lack of hiking trails in the state he posed the question “Should the Green Mountain Range continue to be sacrosanct to the spirits of the first ‘Green Mountain Boys,’ and to hedgehogs, and untouchable to everybody else?”\nHis answer was the promotion of a club dedicated to creating a trail stretching the entire length of Vermont across the State’s highest peaks.  He recruited many like-minded Vermonters and in 1910, the first meeting of the GMC was held in Burlington Vermont where he was elected President.",
